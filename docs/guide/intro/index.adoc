## Introduction

WildFly Galleon Plugins project includes Galleon plugin and Maven plugin implementations that are dedicated to 
building feature-packs (including generation of feature specs, packages and other resources) for WildFly releases and provisioning of WildFly-based distributions. 
These plugins can also be used by projects that integrate into or extend WildFly.

### Maven plugins

This Maven tooling allows to build feature-packs that can be combined with WildFly feature-packs to produce customized WildFly server installations.

The Maven plugin "org.wildfly.galleon:wildfly-galleon-maven-plugin" exposes 2 goals:

* `build-feature-pack`: A goal to be used by WildFly developers when defining WildFly feature-packs that 
implement new WidFly subsystems and expose new server capabilities.

* `build-user-feature-pack`: A goal to be used by WildFly server users in order to define new Layers, new JBoss Modules, ... that depend on existing WildFly 
subsystems and capabilities.

### Galleon plugins

During provisioning, a WildFly specific Galleon plugin is executed to install the WildFly server.
This plugin can be configured with a set of options in order to tune the WildFly server installation.
The way to provide these options is tool specific.

* For the link:https://github.com/wildfly/galleon/[Galleon] CLI command line tool: the options are exposed using completion (TAB key) for the `install` command.
Options can also be set in the `provisioning.xml` file when using the `provision` command. A `provisioning.xml` file example:
```
<installation xmlns="urn:jboss:galleon:provisioning:3.0">
    <feature-pack location="wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):current"/>
    <options>
        <option name="jboss-fork-embedded" value="false"/>
        <option name="jboss-maven-dist"/>
    </options>
</installation>
```
* For the link:https://github.com/wildfly/galleon/[Galleon] Maven plugin configuration: The `<plugin-options>` element contains the options as XML elements.
For example:
```
<configuration>
...
 <plugin-options>
  <jboss-fork-embedded>true</jboss-fork-embedded>
 </plugin-options>
...
</configuration>
```

* For the link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-maven-plugin/[WildFly Maven plugin] configuration: The `<galleon-options>` element contains the options as XML elements.
For example:
```
<configuration>
...
 <galleon-options>
  <jboss-fork-embedded>true</jboss-fork-embedded>
 </galleon-options>
...
</configuration>
```

* For the link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/[WildFly Bootable JAR Maven plugin] configuration: The `<plugin-options>` element contains the options as XML elements.
For example:
```
<configuration>
...
 <plugin-options>
  <jboss-fork-embedded>true</jboss-fork-embedded>
 </plugin-options>
...
</configuration>
```

* For the link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/prospero[prospero] tool, you can define a `provisioning.xml` file that contains the options.
A `provisioning.xml` file example:
```
<installation xmlns="urn:jboss:galleon:provisioning:3.0">
    <feature-pack location="wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):current"/>
    <options>
        <option name="jboss-fork-embedded" value="false"/>
        <option name="jboss-maven-dist"/>
    </options>
</installation>
```

#### Installation Plugin options

[cols="1,2,3,4"]

|===
|Option 
|Type
|Default value
|Description 

|jboss-bulk-resolve-artifacts
|Boolean
|false
|Maven artifacts that are needed for the WildFly server installation are resolved in a bulk operation instead of 
being resolved individually. That can speed-up the provisioning time.

|jboss-dump-config-scripts
|String
|NONE
|A path to a directory in which WildFly CLI script files used to generate the server configurations are stored.

|jboss-fork-embedded
|Boolean
|false
|Fork in a separate process the generation of the server configuration files. Server configuration generation implies the usage of a WildFly Embedded server.
It is advised to set this env variable to true, specially when having multiple executions of the provisioning inside the 
same process (e.g.: multiple executions of Galleon\|WildFly\|Bootable JAR Maven plugins).

|jboss-maven-dist
|Boolean
|false
|Provision a thin WildFly server installation with JBoss Modules modules jar resolved from Maven local cache 
and not copied to the `modules` directory.

|jboss-maven-repo
|String
|NONE
|A path to a directory in which all the resolved Maven artifacts jars and associated pom files are stored. 
The generated directory complies with the filesystem layout of a Maven repository. This respository can then be used as the local cache 
of a thin WildFly server (see `jboss-maven-dist` option). 

|jboss-overridden-artifacts
|'\|' separated list of maven coordinates in the following syntax: GroupId:ArtifactId:Version:[Classifier:]Extension
|NONE
|A list of Maven artifact coordinates used to override the artifact versions that are defined in the provisioned WildFly feature-pack.
For example, to override undertow-core: `io.undertow:undertow-core:2.3.1.Final::jar`

|jboss-reset-embedded-system-properties
|Comma-separated list of String
|NONE
|When executing a forked process to generate the server configuration, all system properties defined in the parent process are inherited by the forked process.
Setting this property to an empty value will reset the system properties used by WildFly server during startup.
To reset WildFly specific system properties and some additional properties, add to the comma-separated list the names of system property to reset.
To not reset a WildFly specific system property, add the property name prefixed with `-` to the list.

|jboss-resolved-artifacts-cache
|String
|NONE
|A path to a directory where to cache the resolved Maven artifacts that are not part of the server installation (feature-packs, Galleon plugins, ...).
NOTE: This option is specific to the usage of the link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/prospero[prospero] provisioning tool.

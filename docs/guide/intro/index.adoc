## Introduction

WildFly Galleon Plugins project includes Galleon and Maven plugin implementations that are dedicated to building feature-packs (including generation of feature specs, packages and other resources) for WildFly releases and provisioning of WildFly-based distributions. These plugins can also be used by projects that integrate into or extend WildFly (Core, Servlet or Full base distributions).
